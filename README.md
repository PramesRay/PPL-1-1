# FITIVITIES

This repository is a final website project from Software Project Class, Teknik Informatika Universitas Padjadjaran. 

[Challenge Guidelines](challenge-guideline.md)

In this project, we build a software based on a website that is engaged in sports, to be precise, a gymnastic website. As in general, the programming languages that will be used are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which will certainly be assisted by a framework. We will use Tailwind as a CSS Framework that will be used by the FrontEnd team and NodeJS as a Javascript framework that will be used by the Backend team. And the website will also use Midtrans as a payment gateway system to support the needs of membership features in the website functionality that we will build. The software we build is website-based with the hope that users will be able to access it more easily. We built this website with the aim of making it easier for target users to enjoy the services of a gym, such as easy access to gym information, starting a subscription to become a member, using physical facilities, and so on. In addition, this website also makes it easier for admins to monitor the membership of their gym members.
